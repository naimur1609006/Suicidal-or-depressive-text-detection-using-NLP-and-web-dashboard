This project implements a system for detecting suicidal and depressive text using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. It compares four models — RNN, GRU, BERT, and RoBERTa — to identify the most effective approach. After evaluation, RoBERTa was chosen as the best-performing model.

The system features a social media demo where the selected RoBERTa model monitors text in real time and detects suicidal or depressive content. When such content is identified, the system automatically notifies the user’s friends via email, enabling timely intervention and support.
